# Computer Organisation Project: RISC-V Assembler & Simulator

This project simulates a basic computer architecture, including an **assembler** and an **instruction-level simulator**. It demonstrates how assembly instructions are translated into machine code and executed, offering hands-on insight into computer organisation concepts.

---

## Files Overview

- `Assembler.py` – Converts assembly code to binary instructions.
- `simulator.py` – Simulates the execution of binary instructions.
- `test2.txt` – Sample input program in assembly language.
- `README.md` – Project documentation (you’re reading it!).

---

## How to Run

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- VS Code or any IDE/text editor

### Running the Assembler and Simulator

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Open the folder in VS Code** (recommended).
3. **Run the assembler** to generate machine code:

```bash
python3 Assembler.py
```

4. **Then run the simulator** to simulate the output:

```bash
python3 simulator.py
```

> Make sure `test2.txt` contains the correct format of assembly code expected by `Assembler.py`.
